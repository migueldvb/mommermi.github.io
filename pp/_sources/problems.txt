Problems?
=========

If you encounter problems, e.g., PP stops unexpectedly or crashes,
please don't hesitate to contact me (michael . mommert (at) nau . edu)
and attach the following things to your email:

* the **LOG file** of your PP process (can be found in the
  ``.diagnostics/`` directory, and 

* the **error message** that was printed on the screen.

I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
